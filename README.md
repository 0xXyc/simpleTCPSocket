# simpleTCPSocket
Simple socket in C that makes a quick HTTP GET request to Google.com on port 80. This could easily be swapped out for another remote host as well.
# Introduction
This is a simple introduction guide to learning sockets in C. Shout out to [Berkeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets)! 
# Usage
The code in this example is hardcoded but could easily be swapped out for something else. For example, take the `send()` function, you can swap out the contents for the `mess` variable to change the GET request to something of your choosing.
